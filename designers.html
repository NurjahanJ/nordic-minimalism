                <p class="philosophy-text">Despite spanning nearly a century, these designers share fundamental beliefs that define Nordic Minimalism: design should serve human needs, embrace natural materials, and create calm, beautiful spaces accessible to all. Their work demonstrates that minimalism is not about emptiness, but about finding the essential—the perfect balance of form, function, and feeling.</p>
